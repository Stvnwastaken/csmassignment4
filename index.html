    <h1>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)</h1>
    <p>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can
        offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access
        traditionally available only to native applications. PWAs are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Progressive: They work on any browser, but provide the best experience on modern browsers.</li>
        <li>Responsive: They fit any screen size, providing a seamless experience on desktop or mobile devices.</li>
        <li>Connectivity independent: They can work offline or on low-quality networks, making them ideal for unstable
            network connections.</li>
        <li>App-like: They feel like native apps, providing immersive, full-screen experiences.</li>
        <li>Linkable: They can be shared via URL and do not require complex installation.</li>
        <li>Discoverable: They are identifiable as "applications" thanks to W3C manifests and service workers
            registration, allowing search engines to find them.</li>
        <li>Safe: They are served via HTTPS to ensure content integrity, providing security with encryption.</li>
        <li>Re-engageable: They make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.</li>
        <li>Installable: Users can "keep" apps they find most useful on their home screen without the need for an app
            store.</li>
        <li>Linkable: They allow users to share apps via URL, and do not require complex installation.</li>
    </ul>
